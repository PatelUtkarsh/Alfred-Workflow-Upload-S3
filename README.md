# Alfred Workflow: Upload Screenshot to Oracle Object Storage

This workflow helps you upload screenshot in your clipboard or local disk to oracle object-storage using s3 compatible API and put the public url of the image to your clipboard.

Oracle offers [always free 10gb object-storage](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/#always-free) which is plenty. 

Using tinypng api will reduce screenshot size drastically and help enduser save bandwidth.

## Overview

This workflow is written in Python and used Boto3 as AWS client to upload files.

Upload clipboard image directly or upload a file.
